  ""reason"": ""Nvidia has released a stellar Q3 earnings report and announced an upbeat guidance in recent days. Despite this, its shares depreciated after the results were revealed and currently trade below the $500 per share level.\n\nThe biggest upside that Nvidia has going for it is the broader adoption of generative AI by major enterprises around the globe.\n\nIn addition to all of that, the biggest upside for the company is that as the demand for the deployment of generative AI by enterprises and countries for their own needs has skyrocketed, Nvidia is the only one so far that can satisfy those needs.\n\nThe competition is trying to catch up and capture some portion of the market share from Nvidia, but it’s unlikely that that’s going to happen anytime soon.\n\nWhile AMD and Intel are preparing to launch their own GPUs for generative AI that are similar to the H100 series, Nvidia has already started to ship its GH200 superchip for supercomputers in Q3 and is about to release its next-generation GPU for generative AI called H200 next year.\n\nThe first major clients of the newest GPU are expected to be all the major cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Oracle (ORCL), which indicates that Nvidia is significantly ahead of its competition.\n\nAs a result, there’s a possibility that Nvidia once again exceeds expectations, which would lead to an upward revision of my assumptions and a greater fair value.\n\nThe good news, though, is that Nvidia believes that the decline in China will be offset by other markets, as it seems that the demand is not decreasing while the backlog remains robust.\n\nAt the same time, the upcoming launch of H200 next year and the ability to offer the full CUDA stack to its clients make Nvidia the only company that could truly power the ongoing generative AI revolution at this stage."",

This suggests that investors may still be bullish on Nvidia stock in the long term, especially given the company's strong position in the AI market. Overall, the news is mixed, and the impact on Nvidia's stock price is difficult to predict.

While this news is certainly negative for Nvidia, as it could potentially impact the company's future revenue and growth prospects, it's essential to consider that the overall market sentiment is also contributing to the decline in Nvidia's stock price. The article mentions that the S&P 500 declined by 0.54%, indicating a broader market downturn. Additionally, the report notes that investors are rotating out of growth stocks like Nvidia and into value stocks due to the recent rise in US Treasury yields, which has made returns on stocks less attractive.
