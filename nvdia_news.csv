However, the question of how long this upswing can be sustained merits consideration.\n\nAt first glance, it might appear that Nvidia's momentum could carry on indefinitely, given the seemingly impregnable moat the company has built around itself."", ""The Nvidia Moat Explained\n\nTo grasp why Nvidia is experiencing such an upswing, it's crucial to first comprehend the nature of the company's operations.\n\nFor almost three decades, Nvidia has specialized in the sale of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or graphic cards."", 'Setting aside the fact that Nvidia arguably creates the best GPUs money can buy, another question arises: ""What else does Nvidia do?""

If it captures 60% of the market, Nvidia could see revenues of $90B.

Unfortunately for Nvidia, the more modest ""Meh"" scenario appears more likely at this time.', 'As I\'ve previously mentioned, it seems unlikely that data centers will indefinitely tolerate paying a premium, and this is one of the most significant risks facing Nvidia.\n\nSo why maintain a ""hold"" position? There\'s a chance Nvidia Corporation could successfully navigate these challenges.', 'I recently released this breakdown on Nvidia to YouTube. It covers the basics, why Nvidia is perfect for AI, and more.', 'The largest holding for this ETF is Nvidia (NVDA), which is up a staggering 237% from the October lows. This is bargain hunting on steroids.\n\nOther reasons include things like increased demand: Semiconductors are crucial components in various industries, including technology, automotive, telecommunications, and consumer electronics.']"
